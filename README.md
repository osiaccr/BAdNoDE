# Node website

This is one of the first web apps that I ever created and it shows. Somehow it has survived without being deleted untill this day, so here is sits, a display for what not to do.

Who needs a template engine when you can just have string concatenations to generate html.

Who needs a ORM when you can just write querries by hand and have SQL Injection vulnerability included.

This whole project belongs on r/badcode
